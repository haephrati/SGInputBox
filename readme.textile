h1. About SGInputBox

An article by Michael Haephrati: 
There are several building blocks in programming that are available in most of the languages and make life easy. For example, the ability to pop up a message. In Win32 that would be MessageBox(). Another building block is Inputbox. InputBox() is a very handy command for prompting the user for an input. You can find it in VBA and Visual Basic. However, while Message Boxes can be easily displayed in any c++ program, there is no direct way for calling InputBox like command. For that reason I created SGInputBox(). I am providing this code as a Static library, and with no Resources, which I think is the most comfortable way to be used, and it can be used by Console Applications, plain Win32 applications or any other type of c++ application.
